# Stock

A simple C# learning project for practicing OOP fundamentals, collections, and unit testing with xUnit.  
The solution contains:
- `Product` – a basic data model
- `Stock` – a class for managing a list of products (adding, finding, removing)
- `Stock.Test` – a separate xUnit test project with unit tests

The goal of the project is to learn the basics of C#, object-oriented programming, working with NuGet packages, and writing simple unit tests.
